### bgpls-broker

This project is a work in progress that exposes an API to the user what the network looks like using BGP Link State (BGP-LS). For more details, I recommend you take a look at these RFCs:

- https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8571
- https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7752

In a nutshell, ExaBGP exposes TCP/179 (BGP) to peer with your router and gather BGP-LS information. A local script runs under the API for ExaBGP which will read stdin and take this data, send a POST request to the bgplsapi container. This container is just a middle man and will pass every BGP UPDATE into a RabbitMQ Queue which workers will consume and perform the main functions (determines which type of BGP-LS update is it, updates/deletes MongoDB). The bgplsapi container then exposes an API to the user to gather all the details related to a specific ASN. Below is a diagram how this all works.

Sample configurations for exabgp and vendor configurations can be found at: [samples](../blob/master/samples/)

The application tries to maintain the state of the network based on UPDATEs received from the ExaBGP api. BGP-LS Nodes have a generated "node_id" which is globally unique as per ![BGP-LS extensions for Segment Routing](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-idr-bgpls-segment-routing-epe-19). The node_id is generated by using the ASN:Router-ID. These tuple values should be globally unique (otherwise your network is designed wrong). BGPLS-Links and BGPLS-Prefixes will have a relationship to a BGPLS-Node and therefore the API is able to pull all related BGP-LS Updates for a given ASN/Node.

Upon receiving an update to an existing entry in the database, it will update the entry. If a withdraw has been received then the workers will simply delete this based on a fairly strict search (eg. BPGLS-Node uses on the node_id but BGPLS-Link will check node_id, l3_routing_topology, interface-address and more...)

If a neighborship goes down between ExaBGP and the network, this is relayed to the API and will perform a cleanup for any related entries in the database (BGPLS-Node/Link/Prefixes) and will flush out the database. I have yet to still improve this feature/general database operations and cleanups since the database may not always be in sync with the network when the containers are restarted.

Currently, the API only exposes a few endpoints for the user. Here are the useful ones to gather some data if you are trying out this project and have successfully peered with the ExaBGP container from your network.

- /api/get_topology/<asn> - Returns the topology (more like a TED if TE functions are enabled) for given ASN
- /api/mongodb/get_collections - Returns the collections (eg. neighbor_state, bgpls_node, bgpls_links, bgpls_prefixes_v4 and bgpls_prefixes_v6)
- /api/mongodb/neighbor_state - Returns all entries in the neighbor_state collection
- /api/mongodb/bgpls_nodes - Returns all entries in the bgpls_nodes collection
- /api/mongodb/bgpls_links - Returns all entries in the bgpls_links collection
- /api/mongodb/bgpls_prefixes_v4 - Returns all entries in the bgpls_prefixes_v4 collection
- /api/mongodb/delete_collection/<collection> - Removes all entries in the collection specified.

You can find examples of what data is exposed from these databases in the samples folder (linked at the start of the readme). Please not that these samples may not be the most recent representation of data in the future if I forget to update documentation.

This project is not production ready and I would advise to run it in a lab if you want to play around with it.
